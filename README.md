# PrintNumbersOfPI
 
I find this project on Clash Of Code in CodinGame. This is the first time I publish my code on Github so if any one can see it, just tell me how to improve it. Thanks

The objective is to print numbers of PI (3.14....) but when you put in a number, the output numbers will print out exactly the same digit in the input number
To do this project, I use a lot of Math function like PI, Round and Pow to calculate the output number and put it in string to easily reduce the number and change it to the final product using the Substring function.
That's all!

If you want to see my code, go to the LearningC# folder and open the Program.cs!

Thank you :)))
